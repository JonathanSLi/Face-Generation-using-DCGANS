# Face-Generation-using-DCGANS-

This project is a part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.
Defined and trained a DCGAN on a dataset of celebrity faces. 

## Goal
Create a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
Visualized results of new generated faces is in the repo notebook.

## Get the Data

[CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train your adversarial networks.

It is suggested that you utilize a GPU for training since the dataset is complex.
